I am currently pursuing a graduate degree in Data Science at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas. Prior to this, I
accumulated a decade of experience as an HVAC and plumbing engineer
within the engineering consulting industry, before transitioning to the
technical field. Since embarking on this career shift, I has acquired
proficiency in object-oriented programming and advanced algorithms using
Java and C++, as well as demonstrating proficiency in SQL and
effectively applying it within the MySQL database system.

Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
